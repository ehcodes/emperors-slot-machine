## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, jQuery

On this slot machine I used sections to house each of the 3 reels, there is a total off 7 winning combinations.The images are stored as array elements and when the user clicks the "Spin the Wheel" button jQuery runs the machine.

## Lessons Learned:

Here I learned of the Math object in javascript and a few of it's properties.

## Examples:
Take a look at the rest of my portfolio.
